# PicoKeypad
Using the Raspberry Pi pico and the pimoroni silicon rgb keypad for the pico I've added two more oled diplsays and programmed some games to get started 

Connect two OLED displays as following pins on the Pico;
oled 1
SDA: pin 6 
SCL: pin 7 

oled 2
SDA: pin 24
SCL: pin 25

then make the neccisary power connections for the two displays.

3d files for printing the case can be found here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5767177 or in the Case folder within the repository
The OLED diplsays where hot glued onto the display holder in the center
